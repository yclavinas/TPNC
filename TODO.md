# OTHER:

Where is data about the relative intensity method?  



# Images

Add an image to the first page of the paper. Could be the same image as the 
first image of the ECTA paper.  

Add an image explaining the differences of the representations between the 
GAmodel and the ReducedGAModel  




# General

The idea of the paper is to try and improve GA-generated models of earthquake
risk.  

We try three approaches: 

1.Genome structure: The GA either tries to adjust the risk estimation of each 
bin (original model), or the location of "mainshocks" (reduced model)

2.Use of expert knowledge: (emp vs non emp)

3.Use of clustering of the database

In this paper, we study each of the three approaches and test them to determine
which approaches produce the best models.

*Important* treat the three approaches as separate axis, expain each of them 
one at a time. 

*Important* check each of the sentences in the paper on how they relate
(explain or follow) the goals above.
